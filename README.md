hello!

supabase and firebase are both react apps:
`npm install` to install (in their own directories!)
`npm start dev` to start them!


aws_rds shows you a simple php app that connects with a MySQL database deployed on AWS RDS.
you can deploy it to heroku with:
`heroku login` login with credentials first
`heroku create` create the application first
`git push heroku main` push to the heroku reference, `git init`, `git add *`, `git commit -m "commit message"` then run git push heroku main, if you don't have a git repo initialized

Please let me know if you need help with this demo, or want to share anything!
